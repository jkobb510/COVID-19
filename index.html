        <h4 style="margin-top: 25px;">COVID-19</h4>
        <p style="margin-top: 25px;">
            COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus,
            named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
            It originated in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, Central China.
            The disease was first identified in December 2019 and has since
            spread globally,
            resulting in an ongoing pandemic. Since the initial outbreak,
            misinformation and politicization of the disease has been common.
        </p>
        <p>The symptoms of COVID-19 are diverse, often encompassing fever,
            cough, headaches, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and the loss of
            the senses of smell and taste. These symptoms may manifest between
            one to fourteen days following exposure to the virus. A noteworthy
            fact is that a substantial portion of those infected, approximately
            one-third, remain asymptomatic. Among those who do display symptoms,
            around 81% exhibit mild to moderate effects, 14% face severe
            symptoms, and 5% endure critical conditions, especially the elderly.
            Additionally, some individuals suffer lingering effects, commonly
            referred to as "long COVID," with observed organ damage, prompting
            ongoing multi-year investigations.
        </p>
        <p>Efforts to combat the pandemic include the approval and distribution
            of COVID-19 vaccines, mass vaccination campaigns, and preventive
            measures like social distancing, quarantine, ventilation, mask
            usage, hand hygiene, and symptomatic treatment. Work is ongoing to
            develop drugs to combat the virus effectively.
