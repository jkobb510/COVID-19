                COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
                It originated in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, Central China. The disease was first identified in December 2019 and has since spread globally, 
                resulting in an ongoing pandemic. Since the initial outbreak, misinformation and politicization of the disease has been common.
                <br><br>
                The virus is spread mostly through close contact (within 6 feet), primarily through respiratory droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, and talking. 
                It can also transmit through surfaces where the droplets land (called "fomites"). Recently, an overwhelming amount of experts have suggested that 
                the virus is airborne and can easily transmit through aerosols, which are tiny respiratory droplets that can remain suspended in the air, as opposed
                to larger droplets that fall to the ground within a few feet. 
                <br><br>                                                                               
                The image below shows the common symptoms. The incumbation period is the period before symptoms show, which may be from 2-14 days after exposure to 
                the virus. A majority of infections are mild (80%), while 15% are severe and 5% are life threatening. Severity increases with age and preexisting 
                conditions such as cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic lung disease, and diabetes mellitus.

                 It is estimated the for every one person who contracts COVID-19, 2 to 2.5 other people will be infected on average. This called the R0 (pronounced "R naught"). The illustration below shows the minimum R0 of COVID-19, which is 2.
