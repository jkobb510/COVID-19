                    <strong>Remdesivir</strong> is a broad spectrum antiviral medication by Gilead Sciences and is administered via injection into a vein.
                    While not approved for any indication, the drug has shown to be have antiviral activity against RNA viruses such as SARS coronavirus and 
                    MERS coronavirus. The most promising evidence we have for Remdesivir's treatment for COVID-19 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled
                    trial of 1063 patients by The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID). In that study, Remdesivir was shown to be superior 
                    than placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with Covid-19 and symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection. 
                    Currently, Remdesivir is authorized for emergency use in the US, India, Singapore, and approved for use in Japan for people with severe 
                    symptoms.      </p>

                    <strong>Dexamethasone</strong> is a low cost steroid that can treat inflammation that can be given orally or intervenously. In March 2020, 
                    the Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy Trial (RECOVERY) was established in the UK. This trial tested a range of potential treatments
                    for COVID-19. Dexamethosone was one of these potential treatments and the trial showed that dexamethasone reduces death by up to one third 
                    in hospitalized patients with severe respiratory complications of COVID-19. Dexamethasone has also been shown to enhance the effects a form 
                    of Vitamin D3 called Calcitriol by increasing Vitamin D receptor transcription. There has been a significant link between Vitamin D and 
                    COVID-19 mortality.</p>

                    <strong>Vitamin D</strong> plays a role in the functioning of the immune system and modulates white blood cells by preventing them from 
                    releasing too many inflammatory cytokines. This could help lessen the Covid-19-induced cytokine storm. Vitamin D also helps to reduce lung                                   
                   injury and reduces the risk of acute respiratory tract infections. Many researchers from different countries have found that the sickest patients
                    had the lowest levels in vitamin D and countries with higher death rates had larger numbers of people with vitamin D deficiency than countries 
                    with lower death rates. </p>
