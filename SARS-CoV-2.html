            The name of the virus that causes COVID-19 is SARS-CoV-2. SARS stands for "<strong>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome</strong>".                      
            The virus is believed to have originated from a bat, like the first SARS disease in 2003, but went through an intermediate host in                     
            a Wuhan wet market before jumping to a human. The animal origin of the virus is makes COVID-19 a <strong>zoonotic</strong> disease.
                 <br><br>                 
            "CoV" stands for coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a family of RNA viruses that cause disease in animals and birds. "Corona" means "crown" in Latin 
            and the term "coronavirus" was coined due the <strong>spike proteins</strong> that project out from the surface of the virus, resembling a crown 
            (shown below). The "2" means that this is the second SARS-CoV virus identified, with the first being that of the <strong>2003 SARS 
            outbreak</strong> in Asia.

        <h3> Viral Structure </h3>
        <p class ="a">                         
             Viruses are protein packages that surround genetic material. They <strong>require a host</strong> in order to replicate. 
            Above, we see the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Inside the virus, we see the <strong>RNA</strong> and <strong> Nucleocapsid protein
            </strong> (N protein). The RNA is the genetic material and the N protein forms complexes with the RNA and plays role in enhancing 
            the efficiency of virus <strong>transcription</strong> (production of mRNA that gets translated to form proteins) and <strong>assembly</strong> 
            (proteins assembling around the RNA to form a protein shell called  a "<strong>capsid</strong>"). 
                            
            <br><br>Surrounding the RNA and N protein is the <strong>viral envelope</strong>, which protects the genetic material. 
            The <strong>hemoglutinin-esterases</strong> are glycoproteins which recognizes the host receptor and acts as an enzyme to destroy the receptor.
            The spike glycoprotein is the primary structure that allows the virus to infect a host cell. In the initial step that leads to COVID-19, 
            this <strong>spike protein</strong> connects to the <strong>ACE2 receptor</strong> of the host cell, which is most abundant in the lungs. 
            Many drugs undergoing development have found potential molecules that can prevent the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 from attaching to the ACE2 
            receptor of the host cell.
