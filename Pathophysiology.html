            <h3> Replication</h3>
                
              <p class ="a"> 
                 SARS-CoV-2 virus primarily affects the respiratory system. When it enters the body, the <strong>spike proteins</strong> 
                 of the virus attaches the <strong>ACE2 receptors</strong> in the lungs, specifically, <strong>Type II alveolar cells </strong>. 
                 The virus generally enters the cell via <strong>endocytosis</strong>, which is the direct fusion of its envelope into the host membrane. 
                 The virus is then <strong>uncoated</strong>  and the genome enters the cell cytoplasm.
                     <br><br>
                 SARS-CoV-2 has a <strong>single stranded RNA</strong>, which attaches the <strong>host ribosome</strong>. The ribosome translates the RNA
                  into proteins that will make <strong>RNA polymerase</strong>. The RNA polymerase will read the positive RNA strand to make a <strong>negative
                  RNA strand</strong>. The negative strand will be used by the same RNA polymerase to make a positive RNA strand and other small positive RNA strands.
                  These strands will be read by host ribosomes within the <strong>ER</strong>, to make the structural components of the virus. The ER transfers the 
                  accessory and structural proteins into the <strong>Golgi apparatus</strong>, which packages these components with positive RNA strand to form a new 
                  viruses. These viruses are then released from the cell via exocytosis.

        <h3>Cell Damage  </h3>
              
        <p class ="a" style="margin-top: 10px;">                      
                Beyond self-replicating in alveolar cells, SARS-CoV-2 also damages them. This initiates the <strong>inflammatory response</strong>, 
                releasing interferons, cytokines, and Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). <strong>Interferons</strong> cause nearby cells 
                to heighten their antiviral defenses. <strong>Alveolar macrophages</strong> detect cell injury and respond to the cytokines released by 
                the injured alvelor cells. This causes the macrophages to secrete a a variety of <strong>inflammatory cytokines</strong>, such as 
                <strong>interleukins (TNF-a, IL1, IL6, IL8) and chemokines</strong>. This inflammatory process stimulates nerve endings that causes the 
                <strong>dry cough</strong> common in COVID-19 patients.

         Notice from the image above, COVID-19 can also affect the intestines. 
            In some cases, it may abdominal pain, diarrhea, appetite loss, nausea and vomiting. </div>
          
            <p class ="a" style="margin-top: 10px;">
                      
                <strong>TNF-a</strong> and <strong>IL1</strong> increase <strong>vascular permeability</strong> and the increase in expression of <strong>
                adhesion molecules</strong>. <strong>Neutrophils</strong> and <strong>monocytes</strong> bind to the adhesion proteins      
                and enter the site of injury. <strong>IL8</strong> will recruit more neutrophils and chemokines will recruit more monocytes.                     
                The increased vascular permeability causes leakage of fluid that results in <strong>interstitial and pulmonary edema</strong>. 
                The pulmonary edema leads to <strong>shortess of breath</strong>  and <strong>low oxygen levels in the blood</strong> (hypoxemia). 
                      <br><br>
                      
                The increase in macrophages and neutrophils in the blood lead to <strong>increase in white blood cell count</strong>. 
                Neutrophils, while acutely beneficial by engulfing virus, they release toxic byproducts that further damage the alveolar cells,                       
                leading  to <strong>less surfactant produced</strong>. This will contribute more <strong>impaired oxygenation </strong>. 
                      
            </p>

             Patient hospitalized from COVID-19 
            <p class = "a">
                The white blood cells and damaged endothelial cells release <strong>inflammatory mediators</strong> like leukotrienes, which leads to 
                 <strong>hypoxemia</strong> (below-normal level of oxygen in blood), and <strong>prostagladins</strong> (along with TNF-a, IL1, and IL6) 
                 that leads to <strong>fever</strong>.
                 <br><br>
                 Decreased oxygen levels in the blood will stimulate <strong>chemoreceptors</strong> which tells the lungs to breathe more and tells the  
                heart to pump faster, leading to <strong>rapid breathing</strong> (tachypnoea) and <strong> rapid heart rate</strong> (tachycardia). 
        </p>
        <h3> Immunity </h3>
        <p class = "a" style="margin-top: 10px;">        
        Macrophages  engulf the virus and present the virus, especially the spike proteins, on its surface. <strong> T cells</strong> will recognize 
        the virus and create an <strong>adaptive immune response</strong>, consisting of B cells which produce antibodies against the spike proteins.
        </p>
       <h3>ARDS</h3>
       <p class = "a" style="margin-top: 10px;">          
        COVID-19 causes <strong>acute respiratory distress syndrome</strong> (ARDS) consisting of injured lungs, accumulation of fluid, 
        ventilation/perfusion mismatch, and hypoxemia. <strong>ARDS is the leading cause of death in COVID-19</strong>.
